## Introduction
This is a project, for the Dutch company named <a href="http://www.tauw.nl">'Tauw'</a>. Tauw is a European  Europees consulting and engineering firm, that gives environmental friendly and sustainable advices to businesses. To help with the creation of a more sustainable world.

They have offices in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain and Italy and have more than 1,000 people working to achive there goal, to make the world better and cleaner.

## Users
- <strong>User 1: </strong> At the moment, whenever someone wants to start a project, that requires a type of sensor. That person needs to talk to someone else in the company, to ask what sensors would be best to use.

 <strong>Current problem: </strong> That person is also busy, so a response could take a while and during that time a project could not continue.

- <strong>User 2: </strong> The second type of user, is a project leader, that knows what sensor is going to be used, but wants to check what the functionalities of that sensor are and how it work.

 <strong>Current problem: </strong> Because there is no accessible database, that contains all the sensors, the project leader needs to ask someone, what interrupts the progress of the project or he/she needs to search on the internet, what could take a while.

- <strong>User 3: </strong> External companies want to share information, about sensors with Tauw and want to help each other.

 <strong>Current problem: </strong> There is no database or public accessible document, where they could place the information. So sharing data is currently very inefficient.

## User stories (will become English soon)
- The selectiontool can use specific criteria, to select the sectors and categories, you want. (Example: Stedelijk gebied  > Water  > Riolering)
- The selectiontool uses filters, to only show the results, that best matching the filters.
- The results show, what kind of sensor you selected, hase a small summary, a project, where the sensor was used and a person, that you can contact when you have a question.
- The database, should be accessible by the employees of Tauw and also external companies (in the future).

## Concept
Our idea, is a responsive website, where the users can easally find the best possible sensors for theire projects, by only knowing where they want to use it.

The webside also gives the user the ability, to find a specific sensor, by name. They than get to see a complete list with a summarty of the sensor, its functionalities, contact persons and example projects.

Currently we are also working on a databse, connected to a online form, where internal or external personal can add a new sensors, that will automaticly be added to the database and show on the side.

## Dependencies
- A basic MVC server: Nodejs, for Server-side scripting.
- A Node.js setup: Express.
- EJS as serverside templating engine
- A clean and widly supported HTML structure.
- Multiple SCSS style sheets (sass)
- JavaScript on Clien-side.
- Gulp to bundle the SCSS in one css, and to automaticly show the changes.
- MongoDB: to store and retrieve data from a database.

## Code conventions
- When making a new branch give it a clear name. (example: /partail/header/colin)
- Work modulair as much as possible, to prefent merge conflicts.
- Templating engine is EJS and try to keep the code clean and logical.
- Use tabs instaid of spaces.
- Give functions and variables clear names.
- Each function handeks on thing/action.
- No jQuery.
- Use Comments in your code, when needed.
- Write all code and comments in English. (!!).
- Use camelcase, when naming items.
- Everything gets it's own SCSS stylesheet (will be merged later).

## Personal development plan
Each of us has his own project plan, with thing they like to focus on, during this project.

#### Korte intro
In 2014 I started with my study (Communication en Multimedia Design (CMD)). In the beginning, I avoided the coding, because I wanted to design for the web, but bit by bit, I have become a real Front-end Developer. I started learning more and more and wanted to improve my knoledge about coding, so I chose to take the minor web Developmet, because I would learn a lot. I also wanted to know more about server-side coding and a bit more about working with databases.

In the "meesterproef", I need to show, that I have to prove, what I have learned the past months. I have chosen the following classes, to focus on:
- Web App from Scratch
- CSS to the Rescue
- Performance Matters
- Browser Technologies

##### Web App from Scratch
During Web App from Scratch, I have learned a new and better structured type of coding. I'm going to use the object literal type of coding, to make the code easy to understand and cleaner. I will also use IFFE's to make the variable a bit more secure.

##### CSS to the Rescue
During CSS to the Rescue, I have learned, that you can do a lot with CSS and don't need Javascript for everything. Thats why I'm going to use CSS, instaid of Javacript, to make the  complex interfaces.

##### Performance Matters
The make the website preforme better, I will try to make the website mostly server-side, to make to prefent the most browser problems. Also, because Tauw (the client) uses IE11, I will need to change/ make fallbacks for the IE version, so even the IE users can use the site like it supposed to be.

##### Browser Technologies
During Browser Technologies I learned the importance of a good HTML and CSS structure. Thats why, I will begin with a clean HTML and CSS structure and will only use the Clien-side Javascript, as enhancements. So even when the user has Javascript turned off, the site will still be accessible and usable.

##### most proud of
I am most proud of, the way the team has worked together, to develop sensor selection tool for Tauw. During that process, we began with a idea and slowly made that idea better and bigger, until it formed into a working web tool, that satifies everyone who is concerned in this project.

In this group I was the one, that know most of the serverside and the javascripts, and I thought it was nice to work with someone, that was more backside development and a good designer. Because of the good teamwork and the great communication. I also had the oppertunity, to learn more about the backend development and the working of the server, what was nice.

#### Korte intro

##### My part in this project

Naturally, I am a Visual Interface Designer. I made a decision to participate to the Minor Webdevelopment with the aim to expand my competences from just a Visual Interface Designer to a versatile Creative Developer with two visions: design and development. It was a very difficult time at the beginning of this Minor, but I am really proud and happy that I made the choice to participate to the Minor.

In this project, I have collaborated with Colin DÃ¶rr and Jaimie de Rijk. It was a fantastic collaboration in which different qualities that a complete product need, came together. Everyone has some competences that adds something extra to the product.

The aim of this master test was to apply at least four subjects from the Minor to the product. In the following list you will find how I have done this:

###### CSS to the Rescue
Everyone in our crew did some CSS. As a Visual Interface Designer, I decided to finish off all the design issues at the end, because I think that I have more eye for design details than my teammates. Ofcourse, they have other incredible qualities.

###### Web App From Scratch
Branch: https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/tree/Backup
At the beginning of this project, I applied some JavaScript to the map that display on the startscreen. In the first iteration, we used pop-ups for showing information after the user has clicked on a sector. For this purpose I use JavaScript to make it possible to toggle in hide and display-mode of specific sector.

###### Performance Matters
Branch: https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/tree/performance

I applied some stuffs which improve the performance of the app, like:

- Compression
- Browserify
- Service Worker

Compression will applied on every request.

Browserify makes a bundle of all JavaScript-files to one file. This method will reduce the amount requests.
The browserify that I have applied was a bit different than during the subjects. This time I used the gulp-version to applied browserify on the project. The benefit of Gulp in this way is that can run every package by one command: gulp.

https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/commit/a1ca74199eed091907a12f10f45609e1ffd04afe


###### Browser Technologies
Branch: https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/commits/partial/filter/nooroel-imamdi

At the first time, I made the filter-section with html5 detail-tag, which is not full supported in IE 11 (browser of the user). I resolved this problem by using input-fields and ul-elements which become active when a specific input-field is checked. This works on every browser, even on IE 5.

There are also solutions with JavaScript-tricks. However, this methode is html & css only and works in every webbrowser. This solution was taken with the philosophy of progressive enhancement in the mind.

https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/commit/5dd83e1549707c031f2c3901d6b6c6d6c18cafd9

###### Most proud of
I am most proud of the way we have develop the interface during this weeks. We started with the idea of the client and after that we gave it an totally own twist as experts, which totally was accepted by the client. Everyone who is concerned in this project is satisfied.

In this group I was the least technical. Nevertheless, It was very instructive to work with people who were technically set up. You learn about their way of working and how to address certain problems. On the other hand, you notice that, as a designer, you may sometimes be bothering what you really mean. That's the advantage to me that I can also go with html, css and javascript and you can customize it all.

###### Documentation

**part: filter**
The filter-part contains the option to folding out relevant content. `html5` makes this possible by the `details`-tag. The problem that occurred is that this tag is not supported in `Internet Explorer` and `Microsoft Edge` while the main users use a Microsoft-machine with these browsers.

![HTML5 details support by Can I Use](https://github.com/ColinDorr/minor-tauw-sensoren/blob/master/readme-files/html5-details-tag-support-caniuse.png?raw=true)
*Can I Use* about support `details` in webbrowsers

I solved this with `CSS` by using the `checked`-selector to display an unordered list with the results. Example:
```
input:checked + ul {}
```

With this method we don't need to use JavaScript and the support of this method starts from `Internet Explorer` 10.

### Jaimie de Rijk

<details>

#### Korte intro
Ik ben een vierde jaars CMDer die zich focust op webdevelopment. Vorig jaar heb ik mij bij de meesterproef te veel gefocust op backend development. Dus bij deze herkansing zal ik mij veel meer richten op frontend.

De vier vakken die ik wil toepassen:

- Web App from Scratch
- CSS to the Rescue
- Performance Matters
- Browser Technologies

**Web App from Scratch**
Interactie bouwen volgens de standaarden van het vak *Web App from Scratch* met behulp van javascript.

**CSS to the Rescue**
CSS die ik me kan herineren uit de minor toepassen op het werkende prototype.

**Performance Matters**
Tijdens het coderen bewust zijn van performance. En andere trucjes toepassen om snelheid te behouden.

**Browser Technologies**
Wij bouwen de app volgens progressive enhancement principe op.
